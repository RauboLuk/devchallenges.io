## Overview

![screenshot](../assets/Screen_Shot_2020-10-12_Interior_consultant.png)

- What was your experience?
This challenge had some tricky parts, e.g. mobile menu or that image on the background that took me some time to complete.
- What have you learned/improved?
This time i moved media query CSS to another file. I leared a bit about how to style checkboxes.
- Your wisdom? :)
There is still so much to improve my styling skills. I think that approach that I chose with background image was harder than it should be. Moreover, when I was styling footer with flexbox it was a bit easier.
